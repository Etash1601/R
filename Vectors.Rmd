## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
v1 = c(3,8,4,5,0,11)
v2 = c(4,11,0,8,1,2)
```
```{r}
add.result = v1+v2
add.result
sub.result = v1-v2
sub.result
```
```{r}
v = c(3,8,4,5,0,11,-9,304)
a = sort(v)
a
revsort.b = sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)
revsort.b
```
```{r}
v = c(3,8,4,5,0,11,-9,304)
m = rep(v, each=2)
print(m)
print(min(v))
print(max(v))
```
```{r}
print(mean(v))
print(sd(v))
```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
